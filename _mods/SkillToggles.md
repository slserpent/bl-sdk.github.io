longDescription: "Lets you deactivate Action Skills by holding a configurable hotkey.\n\nFeatures:\n- deactivate the Action Skills for each character\n- configurable hotkey\n- options to enable deactivation for class individually\n\nNotes:\n- since this is often not the case with SDK mods: yes, this has multiplayer support if all players have it installed\n- deactivating Action Skills won't give you a cooldown bonus\n  - there are some exceptions in Borderlands TPS where it works\n- in a multiplayer environment, only the host settings of the mod are taken into account\n  - that means only the host can define which Action Skills are deactivatable\n  - you can still use your own hotkey\n- the default toggle key is `F` which also is the default Action Skill hotkey\n  - you need to *hold* they key, not just press it to avoid accidental deactivation\n  - you can change it to anything in the modded keybinds but you can't change it back to `F` because it's already taken by the Action Skill\n  - if you want to use the `F` key again, you need to delete the settings.json file in the mod directory, restart the game and reenable the mod\n  - if you are using another hotkey for the Action Skill, you can also directly edit the modded hotkey in the `settings.json` file while the game is closed\n\nEverything related to versions and their release notes can be found in the [changelog](https://github.com/RLNT/bl2_skilltoggles/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).\nIf you found a bug or you have a feature request, please use our issue tracker linked below.\nIn case you need support, please join our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/Q3qxws6)." # Description of what the mod can do
