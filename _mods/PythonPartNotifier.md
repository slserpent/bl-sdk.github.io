longDescription: "Shows the parts making up all of your items and weapons on their cards. Yes this even includes Grenades, COMs, and Relics/Oz Kits. Has full mod support, so if a mod adds extra parts to a weapon or changes a part's mesh it will properly update. Unique part support is limited, they may just show the same as the base part with the same mesh.\n\n![Demo Image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/294502426302742529/614303846256082945/unknown.png)\n\nWhat exactly is shown on the card is very customizable through the options menu. Don't care about a part slot? You can turn it off. Running out of space with all the parts you want to show? You can remove the original description or turn the font size down. Or playing Randomizer and want to know what weapons each part comes from? Why not use detailed part names.\n\nNote that there are thousands of parts, so it's not impossible that the mod gets something wrong, don't be afraid to double check. If you do find an issue please report it alongside a gibbed code for the item." # Description of what the mod can do
