Currently the PythonSDK is open-sourced on [Github](https://github.com/bl-sdk/PythonSDK).
Right now it supports:

It is mainly developed by [Abahbob](https://github.com/Abahbob), [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/FromDarkHell), [apple1417](https://github.com/apple1417).

Most conversations about the PythonSDK happens over on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/VJXtHvh)
