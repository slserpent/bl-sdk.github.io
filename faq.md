# User FAQ
## How to start using PythonSDK mods?
Follow the steps described on the [main page](/).

## Can I use PythonSDK mods with text mods?
Yes. Usual compatibility concerns still apply, like if several mods change the same variables they will interfere with each other. This is the case regardless of whether the mods are PythonSDK mods or text mods.

## What is the difference between PythonSDK mods and text mods?
Text mods can only modify objects once; when run. PythonSDK mods can modify dynamically generated objects and run arbitrary game functions whenever they please.

## Why do I not see Mods menu after installation?
- Ensure you have all the required files; your `Binaries/Win32` folder should have:
    * `ddraw.dll`, 
    * `pythonXX.dll`, 
    * `pythonXX.zip`,
    * A folder named `Mods` **exactly as capitalized**. 
    The `Mods` subfolder should contain an `__init__.py` and the various mods folders (most importantly `ModMenu`) which should each also have an `__init__.py`.
- To be certain, download [latest](https://github.com/bl-sdk/PythonSDK/releases) again and extract and overwrite the files. 
- Ensure you have [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) installed.
- Console output or the contents of `python-sdk.log` in your `Binaries/Win32` folder may contain clues as to what went wrong.

[Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvTYjFjQ-HI).

If you are on Linux: PythonSDK does not yet work natively on Linux, but it seems to work well under SteamPlay/Proton and Wine. See [The README section on Linux](https://github.com/bl-sdk/PythonSDK#linux-steamplayproton-and-wine).

## Why does my game crash/freeze?
If you are running a mod or modpack that modifies skills (such as Skill Randomizer, Exodus), it will crash if you try to make a new character with those mods enabled. First make the new character, then enable those mods.

If that is not your situation, try to narrow down the mod that causes the issue by disabling all other mods and restarting to see if it still happens, and when you find the culprit: contact the mod author, if it's a large modpack they may have a discord server you can ask on, or create an issue on their mod's repository if there is one.

# Developer FAQ


## How do I create a new mod?
1. Create a new folder in the Mods folder
2. Create an `__init__.py` within it with the following basic template:
```python
   import unrealsdk
   from Mods import ModMenu
   
   class MyMod(ModMenu.SDKMod):
       Name: str = "My Mod Name"
       Author: str = "My Name"
       Description: str = "My Mod Description"
       Version: str = "1.0.0"
       SupportedGames: ModMenu.Game = ModMenu.Game.BL2 | ModMenu.Game.TPS  # Either BL2 or TPS; bitwise OR'd together
       Types: ModMenu.ModTypes = ModMenu.ModTypes.Utility  # One of Utility, Content, Gameplay, Library; bitwise OR'd together
       
   instance = MyMod()
   
   ModMenu.RegisterMod(instance)
```
3. Launch the game. Your mod should now appear in the mod manager. If it doesn't, console output / contents of `python-sdk.log` (which can be found in your `Win32` folder, one folder up from the Mods folder) should give a clue as to why.

## How to reload my mod without having to restart the game?
Add the following to your `__init__.py` **before** RegisterMod is called:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unrealsdk.Log(f"[{instance.Name}] Manually loaded")
    for mod in ModMenu.Mods:
        if mod.Name == instance.Name:
            if mod.IsEnabled:
                mod.Disable()
            ModMenu.Mods.remove(mod)
            unrealsdk.Log(f"[{instance.Name}] Removed last instance")

            # Fixes inspect.getfile()
            instance.__class__.__module__ = mod.__class__.__module__
            break
```
Now you should be able to reload your mod by running `pyexec ModFolderName/__init__.py` (change ModFolderName to the name of the folder your mod is in).

**Keep in mind** that restarting your mod like this is not quite the same as restarting the game, as it does not restart game state, so it will not be a clean slate and your mod could potentially behave differently than if you were to restart.
A good practice is to restore anything you've changed back to what it was in your mod class `Disable` method.

## How to make my mod do things when it's enabled?
Override the `Enable` instance method, for example:
```python
class MyMod(ModMenu.SDKMod):
    ...
    def Enable(self) -> None:
        super.Enable()
        unrealsdk.Log("I ARISE!")
```
`super.Enable()` calls the base class `Enable` method, which registers any hooks or network methods, so you should call that first.

`Log` will log a message to the console. Now when you launch the game and enable your mod you should see "I ARISE!" in the console output. Replace that with whatever you want to do upon enable.

Cleanup functionality can go in the `Disable` instance method:
```python
    def Disable(self) -> None:
        unrealsdk.Log("I sleep.")
        super.Disable()
```
`super.Disable()` calls the base class `Disable` method, which removes any hooks or network methods.

Now when you disable your mod you should see "I sleep." in the console output. Replace that with whatever you want to do upon disable.

For other functions you can override, check the `SDKMod` base class, defined in `ModMenu/ModObjects.py` in the Mods folder.

## How to save enabled state?
`SaveEnabledState` allows you to indicate whether your mod should be automatically enabled on subsequent runs if the user enabled it.

Values it can be set to:
* `NotSaved`: The enabled state is not saved.
* `LoadWithSettings`: The enabled state is saved, and the mod is enabled when the mod settings are loaded.
* `LoadOnMainMenu`: The enabled state is saved, and the mod is enabled upon reaching the main menu - after hotfixes are all setup and all the normal packages are loaded.

For example, to set it to `LoadWithSettings` add the following class variable to your mod class:
```python
SaveEnabledState: ModMenu.EnabledSaveType = ModMenu.EnabledSaveType.LoadWithSettings
```
This will save your mod's enabled state in settings.json, and the mod will be enabled when the mod settings are loaded.

## How to add options to the options menu?
Instantiate your options and add them to the `Options` instance variable of your mod class.

See `ModMenu/Options.py` for available option classes you can use.

Here is an example for adding a `Boolean` option:
```python
class MyMod(ModMenu.SDKMod):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.MyBoolean = ModMenu.Options.Boolean(
            Caption="Set My Boolean",
            Description="Whether My Boolean should be on.",
            StartingValue=True,
            Choices=["No", "Yes"]  # False, True
        )
        
        self.Options = [
            self.MyBoolean,
        ]
```

This `Boolean` should now appear in the options menu, under the name of your mod (provided the mod is enabled). You can get the value from it by accessing `self.MyBoolean.CurrentValue`, which, since it's a boolean, will be True or False.

To handle changes to this value in real time, you can override the method `ModOptionChanged`. For example:

```python
    def ModOptionChanged(self, option, new_value) -> None:
        if option == self.MyBoolean:
            if new_value:
                unrealsdk.Log("You turned on My Boolean")
            else:
                unrealsdk.Log("You turned off My Boolean")
```

Note that this function is called before the change to CurrentValue occurred, so we check `new_value` and not `self.MyBoolean.CurrentValue`.

Also note that for backwards-compatibility reasons, upon enable of your mod this function will be called for every option that is not in a `Nested`.

## How to add keybinds?
See `ModMenu/KeybindManager.py`.

Instantiate your keybinds and add them to the `Keybinds` instance variable of your mod class.

Here is an example:

```python
...
def sayHi() -> None:
    unrealsdk.Log("hi")

class MyMod(ModMenu.SDKMod):
    ...
    Keybinds = [
        ModMenu.Keybind("Say hi", "F3", OnPress=sayHi),
    ]
```

Now "hi" will be outputted to the console whenever F3 is pressed while ingame.

Any bindings can be customised by the user in Options > Keyboard / Mouse > Modded Key Bindings.

You can also have bindings the mod performs when a key is pressed in the mods menu by modifiying `SettingsInput` instance variable of your mod class. This works a bit differently, just a dictionary mapping `key`: `action`, where both are `str`. Handle the different actions by overriding `SettingsInputPressed`. See the `SDKMod` base class in `ModMenu/ModObjects.py`.

## How to hook into game functions?
You can use the `@Hook` decorator. PythonSDK will handle the registering and unregistering of hooks itself, so long as you remember to call the base class Enable/Disable if you override those methods.

The function you hook must have the signature:
`([self,] caller: unrealsdk.UObject, function: unrealsdk.UFunction, params: unrealsdk.FStruct)`

Example:

```python
class MyMod(ModMenu.SDKMod):
    ...
    @ModMenu.Hook("WillowGame.WillowPlayerController.SpawningProcessComplete")
    def onSpawn(self, caller, function, params):
        unrealsdk.Log("onSpawn called")
        return True
```

If you return True the function you hooked into will not continue executing as normal, which is sometimes desired, but if you do not want that remember to return True. If I forget return True in this case, I spawn in a weird place, don't have any money, eridium, or anything in my inventory, among other things, because we diverted the logic ordinarily handling all that.

## How to know what game objects to modify?
* Look through decompiled UPKs, as explained in [Writing SDK Mods]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link index.md %}#writing-sdk-mods) section
* Look through objects in BLCMM Object Explorer, and other tools described in the [BLCMods Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki)
* Look at the source of existing [PythonSDK Mods]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link mods.md %})
* Even source of text mods can help, as they can tell you what objects you can modify.

You can discuss what you're trying to do on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/VJXtHvh), and people will probably chime in to help you out!

## How to publish my mod?
Upload your mod(s) to a public repository, then to add it to this site follow the steps on [Adding to the Database]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link index.md %}#adding-to-the-database) in the main page.

Note that you should not commit `settings.json` file nor `__pycache__`, as they are automatically generated.
